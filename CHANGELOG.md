# Changelog

All notable user-facing changes for `SystemCleanup` are recorded here.

## [2026-03-10]

### Changed

- Hardened `Reset Update Cache` so it now waits for service stop/start transitions, verifies the `SoftwareDistribution` and `catroot2` move, and reports a partial reset instead of a false success.
- Updated the Windows 11 block toggle to verify registry writes by readback and to distinguish `Policy active`, `Policy mismatch`, and `Not configured` states in the menu.
